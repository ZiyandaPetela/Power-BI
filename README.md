# Power-BI
# Introduction
* Power BI takes intimidation and hassle out of data analysis and visualization.
* Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft. It provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end-users to create their own reports and dashboards.
* Power BI can connect to a wide range of data sources, including databases, cloud services, Excel files, and web services, allowing users to gather data from various sources and visualize it in meaningful ways.
*  It's often used for data analysis, data visualization, and sharing insights across an organization.

## Describe using Power BI to build data-driven analytics
* Microsoft Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.
*  From data in a simple Microsoft Excel workbook, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses, Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, clean, and model your data without affecting the underlying source, visualize (or discover) what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.
*  Power BI consists of a Microsoft Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop, an online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service, and mobile Power BI apps that are available on phones and tablets.
*  These three elements, Power BI Desktop, Power BI Service, and Power BI Mobile apps are designed to let people create, share, and consume business insights in the way that serves them, or their role, most effectively.

## Explore the different Power BI elements
* To create Power BI Solutions, there are several major building blocks. These elements help not only what data is being presented, but also how it appears to those users who are consuming it.
* Those elements are datasets, reports, and dashboards. All elements are organized into workspaces, and they're created on capacities.
######  More information on the elements:
* Capacities
* Capacities are a core Power BI concept representing a set of resources used to host and deliver your Power BI content.
*  Capacities are either shared or dedicated. A shared capacity is shared with other Microsoft customers, while a dedicated capacity is fully committed to a single customer.
*  Dedicated capacities require a subscription. By default, workspaces are created on a shared capacity.

*  Workspaces
*  Workspaces are containers for dashboards, reports, datasets, and dataflows in Power BI.
*  two types of workspaces: My workspace and workspaces.
